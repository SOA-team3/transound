= New Features

* A precompile_views method has been added to the
  precompile_templates plugin.  This method works with Roda's
  optimized compiled view methods, allowing additional memory
  sharing between parent and child processes.

* A freeze_template_caches! method has been added to the
  precompile_templates plugin.  This freezes the template caches,
  preventing the compilation of additional templates, useful for
  enforcing that only precompiled templates are used.  Additionally,
  this speeds up access to the template caches.

* RodaCache#freeze now returns the frozen internal hash, which can
  then be accessed without a mutex. Previously, freeze only froze
  the receiver and not the internal hash, so it didn't have the
  expected effect.

= Other Improvements

* The view method in the render plugin is now faster in most cases
  when a single argument is used.  When freezing the application,
  an additional optimization is performed to increase the
  performance of the view method even further.
