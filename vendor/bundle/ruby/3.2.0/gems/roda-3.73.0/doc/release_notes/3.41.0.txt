= Improvements

* The performance of the render plugin's view method when passed the
  :content option and no other options or arguments has been improved
  by about 3x, by calling compiled template methods directly.

* The compiled template method for the layout is cleared when the
  render plugin is loaded again, which can fix issues when it is
  loaded with different options that affect the layout.
