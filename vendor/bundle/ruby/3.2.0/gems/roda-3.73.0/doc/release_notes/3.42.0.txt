= New Features

* A recheck_precompiled_assets plugin has been added, which allows
  for checking for updates to the precompiled asset metadata file,
  and automatically using the updated data.

* The common_logger plugin now supports a :method plugin option to
  specify the method to call on the logger.

= Other Improvements

* Plugins and middleware that use keyword arguments are now supported
  in Ruby 3.

* The compile_assets class method in the assets plugin now uses an
  atomic approach to writing the precompiled asset metadata file.

* Minor method visibility issues have been fixed.  The custom_matchers
  plugin no longer makes the unsupported_matcher request method
  public, and the render plugin no longer makes the _layout_method
  public when the application is frozen.
