= New Features

* An optimized_segment_matchers plugin has been added that offers
  very fast matchers for arbitrary segments (the same segments
  that would be matched by the String class matcher).  The
  on_segment method it offers accepts no arguments and yields
  the next segment if there is a segment.  The is_segment method
  is similar, but only yields if the next segment is the final
  segment.

= Other Improvements

* The send_file and attachment methods in the sinatra_helpers plugin
  now support RFC 5987 UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoded filenames,
  allowing modern browsers to save files with encoded chracters. For
  older browsers that do not support RFC 5987, unsupported characters
  in filenames are replaced with dashes.  This is considered to be an
  improvement over the previous behavior of using Ruby's inspect
  output for the filename, which could contain backslashes (backslash
  is not an allowed chracter in Windows filenames).

* The performance of the String class matcher has been slightly
  improved.
