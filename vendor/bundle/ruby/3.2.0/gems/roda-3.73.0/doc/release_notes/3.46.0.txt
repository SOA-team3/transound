= Improvements

* The r.on, r.is, r.get and r.post methods (and other verb methods
  if using the all_verbs plugin) have now been optimized when using
  a single string or regexp matcher, or the String or Integer class
  matcher.  Since those four matchers are the most common types of
  matchers passed to the methods, this can significantly improve
  routing performance (about 50% in the r10k benchmark).

  This optimization is automatically applied when freezing
  applications, if the related methods have not been modified by
  plugins.

  This optimization does come at the expense of a small decrease
  in routing performance (3-4%) for unoptimized cases, but the
  majority of applications will see a overall performance benefit
  from this change.

* Other minor performance improvements have been made.
