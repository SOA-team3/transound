= Improvements

* The r.on optimization added in 3.46.0 has been extended to optimize
  all single argument calls. This results in the following speedups
  based on argument type:

  * Hash matching: 10%
  * Array/Symbol/Class matching: 15%
  * Proc matching: 25%
  * true matching: 45%
  * false/nil matching: 65%

* Other minor performance improvements have been made.
