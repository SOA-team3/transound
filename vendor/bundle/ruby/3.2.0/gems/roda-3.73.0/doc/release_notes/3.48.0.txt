= New Features

* A named_routes plugin has been added, for defining named route
  blocks that you can dispatch to with r.route.  This feature was
  previously available as part of the multi_route plugin, but there
  are cases where the r.route method and support for named routes is
  helpful even when the multi_route plugin is not used (such as when
  the hash_routes plugin is used instead of the multi_route plugin).
  The multi_route plugin now depends on the named_routes plugin, so
  this change should not cause any backwards compatibility issues.
