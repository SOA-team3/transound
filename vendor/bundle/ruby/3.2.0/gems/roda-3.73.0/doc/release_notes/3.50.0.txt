= New Features

* An inject_erb plugin has been added, adding an inject_erb method
  that allows for injecting content directly into the template output
  for the template currently being rendered.  This allows you to more
  easily wrap blocks in templates, by calling methods that accept
  template blocks and injecting content before and after the block.

* A capture_erb plugin has been added, adding a capture_erb method
  for capturing a template block in an erb template and returning
  the content appended during the block as a string, instead of
  having the content of the template block be included directly into
  the template output.  This can be combined with the inject_erb
  plugin to inject modified versions of captured blocks into template
  output.

* The hash_routes plugin now allows calling hash_branch and hash_path
  without a block in order to remove the existing route handler. This
  is designed to be used with code reloading libraries, so that if a
  route file is deleted, the related hash branches/paths are also
  removed, without having to reload all route files.
