= New Features

* The named_routes plugin now allows calling route without a block
  to remove the existing route handler.  The multi_run plugin
  now allows calling run without an app to remove an existing handler.
  These changes are designed to better support code reloading
  libraries, so that if the related file is deleted, the related
  handlers are also removed, without having to reload the entire
  application.

= Other Improvements

* The error_handler plugin now avoids a method redefinition warning
  in verbose warning mode.

= Other

* Roda's primary discussion forum is now GitHub Discussions. The
  ruby-roda Google Group is still available for users who would
  prefer to use that instead.
