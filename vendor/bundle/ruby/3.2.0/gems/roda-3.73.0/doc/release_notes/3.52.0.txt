= New Features

* The typecast_params plugin now supports a :date_parse_input_handler
  option that will be called with all input that will be passed to
  the date parsing methods.  You can use this option to automatically
  truncate input, if that is perferable to raising an error (which is
  how recent versions of Ruby handle too-long input).

= Other Improvements

* The path helper methods added by the path plugin now support
  blocks that use keyword arguments on Ruby 3+.

* The assets plugin now uses OpenSSL::Digest instead of Digest (if
  available) for calculating SRI digests.  This is faster on Ruby 3+,
  where Digest no longer uses the faster OpenSSL::Digest automatically
  if available.

* Roda.freeze now returns self when the multi_route plugin is used.
  This was broken (not returning self) starting in 3.48.0.
