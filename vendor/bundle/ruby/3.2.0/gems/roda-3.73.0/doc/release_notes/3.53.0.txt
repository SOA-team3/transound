= New Features

* An additional_view_directories plugin has been added, which allows
  you to specify additional directories to look in for templates.
  If the template path does not exist when using the default view
  directory, then each additional view directory will be checked,
  returning the first path that exists:

    plugin :additional_view_directories, ['admin_views', 'public_views']

= Other Improvements

* The indifferent_params plugin now avoids a deprecation warning when
  using the rack main branch, which will become Rack 3.
