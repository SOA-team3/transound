= New Features

* You can now override the type attribute for script tags produced
  by the assets plugin, by providing a :type attribute when calling
  the assets method.

= Other Improvements

* Reloading the render plugin after the additional_view_directories
  plugin no longer removes the additional view directories from
  the allowed paths for templates.

* When using Rack 3, Roda will now use an instance of Rack::Headers
  instead of a plain hash for the headers, allowing for compliance
  with the Rack 3 SPEC (which will require lowercase header keys).

* The public, multi_public, and sinatra_helpers plugin now use
  Rack::Files instead of Rack::File if available, as Rack::File will
  be deprecated in Rack 3.0.

* The json_parser plugin no longer rewinds the request body before
  and after reading it when used with Rack 3.0, as Rack 3.0 has
  dropped the requirement for rewindable input.

* The run_handler plugin now closes bodies for upstream 404 responses
  when using the not_found: :pass option.

* The chunked plugin no longer uses Transfer-Encoding: chunked by
  default.  Requiring the use of Transfer-Encoding: chunked made the
  plugin only work on HTTP 1.1, and not older or newer versions. The
  plugin still allows for streaming template bodies as they are being
  rendered.  To get the previous behavior of forcing the use of
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked, you can use the :force_chunked_encoding
  plugin option

* Roda now supports testing with Rack::Lint.  This found multiple
  violations of the Rack SPEC which are fixed in this version, and
  should ensure that Roda stays in compliance with the Rack SPEC going
  forward.

= Backwards Compatibility

* Roda will no longer set the Content-Length header for 205 responses
  when using Rack <2.0.2, as doing so violates the Rack SPEC for those
  Rack versions.

* The drop_body plugin now drops response bodies for all 1xx responses,
  not just for 100 and 101 responses, in compliance with the Rack SPEC.
