= New Features

* hash_branches and hash_paths plugins have been split off from the
  hash_routes plugin, allowing you to use only those parts instead
  of all of hash_routes.

  The hash_branches plugin supports the hash_branch class method
  and r.hash_branches routing method.

  The hash_paths plugin supports the hash_path class method and
  r.hash_paths routing method.
  
  The hash_routes plugin functions as it did previously by
  requiring the hash_branches and hash_paths plugins. It adds
  the hash_routes DSL and r.hash_routes routing method.

* A hash_branch_view_subdir has been added.  It builds on the
  view_options plugin and new hash_branches plugin, automatically
  appending a view subdirectory for each successful hash branch.
  This can DRY up code that uses a separate view subdirectory for
  each branch.

= Other Improvements

* Unprintable characters are now hex escaped in the output of the
  common_logger plugin.  This can protect users who use software
  that respects shell escape sequences to view the logs.

= Backwards Compatibility

* The static_routing plugin now depends on the hash_paths plugin
  instead of the hash_routes plugin, so you will need to update
  your application to explicitly load the hash_routes plugin if
  you were relying on static_routing to implicitly load it.
