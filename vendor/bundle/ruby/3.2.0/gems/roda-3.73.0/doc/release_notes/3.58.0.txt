= New Features

* A filter_common_logger plugin has been added, allowing you to skip
  logging of certain requests in the common_logger plugin. This
  allows you to only log requests for certain paths, or only log
  requests for certain types of responses.

= Other Improvements

* The heartbeat plugin is now compatible with recent changes in the
  rack master branch (what will be rack 3).

* The exception_page plugin will now use Exception#detailed_message
  on Ruby 3.2+, preserving the did_you_mean and error_highlight
  information.  Additionally, the display of exception messages
  has been improved.
