= New Features

* A link_to plugin has been added with a link_to method for
  creating HTML links.

  The simplest usage of link_to is passing the body and the location
  to link to as strings:
 
    # Instance level
    link_to("body", "/path")
    # => "<a href=\"/path\">body</a>"
 
  The link_to plugin depends on the path plugin, and allows you to
  pass symbols for named paths:
 
    # Class level
    path :foo, "/path/to/too"
 
    # Instance level
    link_to("body", :foo)
    # => "<a href=\"/path/to/foo\">body</a>"
 
  It also allows you to pass instances of classes that you have
  registered with the path plugin:
 
    # Class level
    A = Struct.new(:id)
    path A do
      "/path/to/a/#{id}"
    end
 
    # Instance level
    link_to("body", A.new(1))
    # => "<a href=\"/path/to/a/1\">body</a>"
 
  To set additional HTML attributes on the tag, you can pass them as
  an options hash:
 
    link_to("body", "/path", foo: "bar")
    # => "<a href=\"/path\" foo=\"bar\">body</a>"
 
  If the body is nil, it will be set to the same as the path:
 
    link_to(nil, "/path")
    # => "<a href=\"/path\">/path</a>"
 
  The plugin will automatically HTML escape the path and any HTML
  attribute values, using the h plugin:
 
    link_to("body", "/path?a=1&b=2", foo: '"bar"')
    # => "<a href=\"/path?a=1&amp;b=2\" foo=\"&quot;bar&quot;\">body</a>"

= Other Improvements

* Coverage testing has been expanded to multiple rack versions, instead
  of just the current rack release.
