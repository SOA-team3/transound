= Improvements

* The typecast_params plugin now limits input bytesize for integer,
  float, and date/time typecasts.  If the input is over the allowed
  bytesize, typecasting will fail.  This prevents issues with trying
  to typecast arbitrarily large input.

* The default Integer class matcher now limits integer segments to
  100 characters by default, also to prevent issues with typecasting
  arbitrarily large input.  Segments larger than 100 characters will
  no longer be matched by the Integer class matcher.

= Backwards Compatibility

* If the input bytesize limits in the typecast_params plugin cause
  issues in your application, you can use the :skip_bytesize_checking
  option when loading the plugin to disable the checks.

* If the default Integer class matcher limit causes problems in your
  application, you can use the class_matchers plugin to override the
  matcher to not use a limit:

    plugin :class_matchers
    class_matcher(Integer, /(\d+)/){|a| [a.to_i]}
