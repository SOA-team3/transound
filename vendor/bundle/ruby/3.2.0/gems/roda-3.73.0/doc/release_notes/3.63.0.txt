= New Features

* An autoload_hash_branches plugin has been added for autoloading
  route files for each hash branch, instead of requiring the route
  files be loaded up front.  For example, to automatically load a
  route file for a hash branch on the first request to that branch:

    plugin :autoload_hash_branches
    autoload_hash_branch('branch_name', '/path/to/file')
    autoload_hash_branch('namespace', 'branch_name', '/path/to/file')

  The route file loaded should define the expected hash branch.

  It is common to have route files stored in a directory, with the
  file name matching the branch name.  In that case, you can set
  autoloading for all route files in a given directory:

    plugin :autoload_hash_branches
    autoload_hash_branch_dir('/path/to/dir')
    autoload_hash_branch_dir('namespace', '/path/to/dir')

  Note that autoloading hash branches does not work if the application
  is frozen.  This plugin should only be used in development mode for
  faster startup, or when running tests on a subset of the application
  in order to avoid loading parts of the application unrelated to what
  is being tested.

* The mailer plugin now supports a :terminal plugin option to make
  the r.mail method force a terminal match, similar to how r.get
  and other HTTP verb methods work in standard Roda.  This behavior
  will become the default in Roda 4.

= Other Improvements

* The mailer plugin now correctly sets the content_type of the body
  for emails with attachments when using mail 2.8.0+.
