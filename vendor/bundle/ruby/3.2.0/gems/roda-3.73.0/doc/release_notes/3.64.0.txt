= New Features

* An erb_h plugin has been added for faster HTML escaping using
  erb/escape.  erb 4 added erb/escape and it is included in Ruby 3.2.

  The erb_h plugin is added as a separate plugin because it changes
  the behavior of the h method. The h method added by the h plugin
  will always return a new string, but the h method added by the
  erb_h plugin will return the argument if the argument is a
  string that does not need escaping.  By avoiding unnecessary
  string allocations, use of the erb_h plugin can speed up HTML
  escaping.

= Other Improvements

* The autoload_hash_branches plugin added in Roda 3.63.0 will now
  eagerly load the hash branches when freezing the application,
  allowing the application to continue to work after being frozen.
  Additionally, file paths for the hash branches will now be
  automatically expanded, allowing the use of relative file paths.

= Backwards Compatibility

* The expanding of file paths in the autoload_hash_branches plugin
  can break applications that were providing relative paths and
  expecting them to be looked up using the Ruby load path.
