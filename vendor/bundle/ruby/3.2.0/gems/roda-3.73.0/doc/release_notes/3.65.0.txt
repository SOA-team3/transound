= New Features

* An autoload_named_routes plugin has been added for autoloading files
  for a named route setup by the named_routes plugin when there is a
  request for that route.

= Other Improvements

* The path method in the path plugin now supports a :class_name option.
  You can set this option to true and use a class name String/Symbol
  to register paths for classes without referencing the related class,
  useful when autoloading the class.
